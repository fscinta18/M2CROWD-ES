Hello everybody. If you are reading this that means you want to invest M2CROWD company. THIS IS SCAM. Report them and run away.
> # WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

My personal experience was really bad. I invest my money and in the end, I am still fighting with them to grab them back. As proof of my words, I will attach every document I have to show that this feedback is real and you will not invest your money into that scam platform.
> # WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

Everything started 1 year ago. Part of my job is to investigate ways to finance different projects in several countries. So, I decided to invest here: [https://www.m2crowd.com/](https://www.m2crowd.com/), a real estate crowdfunding investment company. Many people give little money to buy a part of the property, m2crowd takes all the funds and gives them to the builder and guarantees X interest after Y months to investors. But during that time, there is no news, they always say that we have problems and you will receive your amount soon.

As you can research a lot of information in the Google Map and Social Networks, that the M2CROWD will never pay, M2CROWD is a ghost company, many people have been fooled, and also me. I am from another city, so we did some investigations with the private agent, and in the end, there is no real company and office and people.

They said they have Fintech, but that's a lie. I checked in the SAT Mexico, so they don’t have that permission.
